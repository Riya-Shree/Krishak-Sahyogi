Problem Statement
:-Crop residue burning during the winter months in Haryana and Punjab has been a persistent issue leading to severe pollution, posing health hazards for millions of people in Delhi and neighboring states.
:-To address this critical problem, our team proposes "Krishak Sahyogi" an innovative online platform and mobile application that will connect farmers with waste management services, recycling facilities, and potential buyers, promoting sustainable waste management practices and reducing air pollution.

1. *Environmental Impact:* Minimize air pollution caused by crop residue burning by encouraging sustainable disposal and management methods.

2. *Sustainable Agriculture:* Promote the use of crop waste as a resource for biofuels, organic fertilizers, animal feed, and other valuable products.

3. *Farmer Empowerment:* Provide farmers with opportunities to monetize crop waste and incentivize sustainable agricultural practices.

4. *Public Health:* Improve air quality in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and neighboring states, thereby enhancing public health and reducing respiratory illnesses.
